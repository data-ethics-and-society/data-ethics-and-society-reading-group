## Description

You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics & Society Reading Groups on either (or both of) 11th November at 12pm and 26th November at 1pm. This time we're going to read [Privacy is Power][LINK-TO-CONTENT] by Carissa Veliz, which was an Economist book of the year back in 2020. It's a powerful call to look rethink the data economy and radically change our data habits. It details how data collection erodes our privacy every day, and why this matters for our power and democracy.

## Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the book, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.

- How influenced are you to change your data habits? How difficult is this to do?
- To what extent does responsibility for privacy lie with the data subjects versus with the data collectors?
- Do you agree that "privacy is power"?
