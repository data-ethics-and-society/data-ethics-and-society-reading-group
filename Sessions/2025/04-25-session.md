## Description

You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics & Society Reading Group on Tue 29 Apr 2025 1:00 PM - 2:00 PM and Wed 14 May 2025 12:30 PM - 1:30 PM.

>[!NOTE]
>This book will be split over two sessions, on the first we will be focusing on the theme of 'AI ethics & AI safety' and on the second the theme of 'The race: lessons learned'. When getting your ticket you can choose to attend one, or both sessions.

This time we're going to read [Supremacy by Parmy Olson][LINK-TO-CONTENT], which was the Winner of the 2024 Financial Times Business Book of the Year Award. I tells the "never-before-told story of the ruthless shadow race between Microsoft and Google, as both compete to develop a mass-market AI while juggling existential questions of ethics, human progress and the future of the world as we know it."

## Discussion points

We will release discussion points closer to the sessions.

* How important is AI safety in your view?
* To what degree does it (the focus on AI safety) obscure, or work alongside, other ethical challenges posed by AI?
* How much did you learn from the book about how technology is shaping our world?
* What do you think about these companiesâ€™ approaches to ethics?
