# Data Ethics & Society Reading Group 06-12-22, [12:30-13:30 GMT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Data+Ethics+and+Society+Reading+Group&iso=20221206T1230&p1=303&ah=1)

## Description

You're welcome to join us for the final Data Ethics & Society Reading Group session of 2022, on Tuesday 6th December 2022 at [12:30-13:30](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Data+Ethics+and+Society+Reading+Group&iso=20221206T1230&p1=303&ah=1).

Tickets on sale now! Ticket sales end on Monday 5th December at 17:00.

We will be discussing [Artificial Unintelligence: How Computers Misunderstand the World](https://uk.bookshop.org/books/artificial-unintelligence-how-computers-misunderstand-the-world/9780262537018), by Meredith Broussard:

> Making a case against 'technochauvinism' - the belief that technology is always the solution—Broussard, a software developer and journalist, argues that it’s just not true that social problems would inevitably retreat before a digitally enabled Utopia... If we understand the limits of what we can do with technology, Broussard tells us, we can make better choices about what we should do with it to make the world better for everyone.

Thank you to Alessia for suggesting the material.

Please consider either buying the book from a local, independent bookseller, or picking up a used copy online, or borrowing from your local library.

## Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.

- How is this book different to _similar_ books you've read before?
- Have you ever encountered '_technochauvinism_' in your work?
- How do you think the author's background as a computer scientist and data journalist affects its narrative?
