# Data Ethics & Society Reading Group, Tuesday 4th June 2024 [13:00-14:00 GMT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Dark+Data&iso=20240604T13&p1=136&ah=1)

## Description

In this session we read [Dark Data](https://darkdata.website/) by David Hand, which examines the data you don’t have, illustrating with many real-life examples how lack of awareness of what you are missing can lead to distorted understanding, incorrect conclusions, and mistaken actions.

## Discussion points

1. The author introduces different types of ‘Dark Data’. Which type did you find most surprising or relevant to your personal or professional experiences? 
2. Do you think you will use the type classifications of Dark Data going forward?
3. The book provides real-life examples where Dark Data led to significant consequences. Is there a particular example that resonated with you the most, and why?
