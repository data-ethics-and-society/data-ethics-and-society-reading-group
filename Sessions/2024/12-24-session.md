## Description

You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics & Society Reading Group on DAY the DATE at [13:30 GMT][LINK-TO-TIMEDATE]. This time we're going to read [The Alignment Problem][LINK-TO-CONTENT] by Brian Christian, which got the #1 spot on The New York Times' Five Best Books About Artificial Intelligence and which "Masterfully surveys the ‚ÄòAI fairness‚Äô community, introducing us to some of its main characters, some of its historical roots, and crucially, many of its philosophical quandaries and limitations" according to Cathy O‚ÄôNeil, author of _Weapons of Math Destruction_, which we read in [May 2023](../2023/05-23-session.md).

Thank you to everyone who voted for this content.

## Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the book, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.
