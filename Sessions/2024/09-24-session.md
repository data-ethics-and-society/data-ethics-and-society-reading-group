# Data Ethics & Society Reading Group, Wednesday 4th September 2024 [13:00-14:00 GMT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Code+Dependent&iso=20240904T13&p1=136&ah=1)

## Description

In this session we will discuss [Code Dependent](https://www.panmacmillan.com/authors/madhumita-murgia/code-dependent/9781529097306) by Madhumita Murgia, which  discusses how AI is changing what it means to be human; the book provides an unrivalled investigation into the impact of AI on how we live now.

## Discussion points

* After reading Code Dependent, has your perspective on the role of AI in society changed?
* If so, how? Which chapters were influential in this? Did this surprise you?
* What do you believe are the major risks our society faces with the increasing adoption of AI systems?
* What does a fair wage for data workers look like? Should this be dependent on location and task, or is a ‘global wage’ appropriate?
