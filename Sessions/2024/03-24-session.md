# Data Ethics & Society Reading Group, [12:00-13:00 GMT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Technology+Is+Not+Neutral%3A+A+Short+Guide+to+Technology+Ethics&iso=20240307T12&p1=136&ah=1)

## Description

You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics & Society Reading Group on Thursday 7th of March at [12:00 GMT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Technology+Is+Not+Neutral%3A+A+Short+Guide+to+Technology+Ethics&iso=20240307T12&p1=136&ah=1).

This time we're going to read [Technology Is Not Neutral: A Short Guide to Technology Ethics](https://www.harebrain.co/books) by Stephanie Hare, which aims to help anyone creating, using, investing in, and regulating technology â€“ and to empower all of us to hold technology to account.

Thank you to everyone who attended our [last session](../2023/12-23-session.md), where we voted for this content.

## Discussion points

1. The book encourages readers to think critically about technology. How has reading this book changed the way you think about the technology around you?
2. How do we promote digital literacy and empower individuals to navigate ethical challenges faced by technology?
3. Do we need a hippocratic oath (e.g. 'do no harm') for technology?
