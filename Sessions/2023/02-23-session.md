# Data Ethics & Society Reading Group 28-02-23, [12:00-13:00 GMT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Bad+Data&iso=20230228T12&p1=136&ah=1)

## Description

You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics & Society Reading Group on Tuesday 28th February at [12:00](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Bad+Data&iso=20230228T12&p1=136&ah=1). This time we're going to watch/read [Bad Data](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/bad-data-data-ethics-and-society-reading-group-tickets-514972074337) by [Georgina Sturge](https://twitter.com/grsturge). Sturge, a statistician at the House of Commons Library,  reveals how governments of the past and present have been led astray by figures littered with inconsistency, guesswork and uncertainty.

Bad Data was chosen based on a poll at our last event, where 62% of people voted for the book.

Please consider either buying the book from a local, independent bookseller, or picking up a used copy online, or borrowing from your local library.

## Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.

1. When is bad data better than no data?
2. Do you think good data can exist that satisfies everyone?
3. How did this book leave you feeling about your role as a public sector data practitioner?
