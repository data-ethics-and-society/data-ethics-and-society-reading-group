## Description

You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics & Society Reading Group on Tuesday the 19th September at [12:00-13:00](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Good+Data-+Data+Ethics+and+Society+Reading+Group&iso=20230919T12&p1=136&ah=1). This time we're going to watch/read [Good Data: An Optimist's Guide to Our Digital Future](https://gooddataguide.com/) by Sam Gilbert, which sheds light on topics such as privacy, consent and algorithmic bias, while offering practical strategies for mitigating the negative impacts and maximizing the positive potential of data-driven technologies.

Thank you to everyone who attended our [last session](./05-23-session.md), where we voted for this content.

## Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the book, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.

1. What does the term "good data" mean to you, and how does it relate to the themes discussed in the book?
2. Reflecting on the book as a whole, which specific ideas discussed by Sam Gilbert resonated with you the most, and why?
3. Does this book teach us anything about how we can better communicate the purposes for which data will be collected/used?
