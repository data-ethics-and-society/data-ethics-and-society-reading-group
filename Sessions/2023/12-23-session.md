# Data Ethics & Society Reading Group 14-12-23, [12:00-13:00 GMT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Escape+from+Model+Land-+Data+Ethics+and+Society+Reading+Group&iso=20231214T12&p1=303&ah=1)

## Description

You're welcome to join us for our next Data Ethics & Society Reading Group on Thursday 14th December at [12:00 GMT](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Escape+from+Model+Land-+Data+Ethics+and+Society+Reading+Group&iso=20231214T12&p1=303&ah=1).

This time we're going to read [Escape from Model Land: How Mathematical Models Can Lead Us Astray and What We Can Do about It](https://www.ericathompson.co.uk/books/) by Dr Erica Thompson, who, drawing on contemporary examples from finance, climate and health policy, explores what models are, why we need them, how they work and what happens when they go wrong.

Thank you to everyone who attended our [last session](./09-23-session.md), where we voted for this content.

## Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the book, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.

- What do you understand by the term ‘Model Land’?
- How does this chime with our experiences; do we agree with the idea of Model Land?
- What practical steps could we do to avoid the pitfalls mentioned in the book?
- What tools do we have, or lack, to escape from model land?
