### Specific Discussion Prompts

A few ideas of specific points of discussion, based on the material:

* Do you think we do enough as civil servants, to think critically about the data we use, and how we use it?
* Are data science practitioners in the civil service adequately informed and engaged in critical reflection about the nature of their practice?
  * Do different kinds of data science roles require different levels of engagement in discussions about data ethics?
  * Can an 'engaged' and thoughtful data science practitioner in government actually make change?
* Should we think critically about 'public good' as civil servants?
* Is working through a lens of intersectional feminism in direct conflict with public sector 'neutrality'?
* What does it mean for data scientists in the civil service, if Ben Green is correct in saying:
  > "if computer science is to productively contribute to creating a better society, it must develop a rigorous methodology that considers what it means to do good and how to choose among competing goods. This requires, first and foremost, a political orientation for algorithmic practice.”
* Ben Green also claims that data practice _is_ political activity:
  > "Whether or not the computer scientists behind this and similar projects recognize it, their decisions about what problems to work on, what data to use, and what solutions to propose involve normative stances that affect the distribution of power, status, and rights across society. They are, in other words, engaging in political activity."
  * Is he right?
