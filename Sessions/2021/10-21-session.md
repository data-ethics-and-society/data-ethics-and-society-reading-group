## Meeting info

### Description

You're welcome to join us for our next Data Science: Ethics & Society Reading Group on Tuesday the 19th October 2021 at [12:30-13:30](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Data+Science+Ethics+Reading+Group&iso=20211019T1230&p1=136&ah=1). 

We will be discussing whether nudging helps or hinders us, whether government should employ nudging to achieve its important policy aims, and what responsibility government and technology companies have when using such methodologies.

It will include discussion of the following material:

Thank you to Callum for suggesting this week's content and leading this month's meeting.

### Discussion points

There will be time to talk about whatever we like, relating to the paper, but here are some specific questions to think about while you're reading.

- What is the purpose of nudging communications and methodologies? Do they help or hinder us? 
- Do you notice when you are being nudged? Or is this the first time you’ve thought about? If the latter, why do you think you haven’t noticed it before?
- Should government employ nudging communications? How can they be used positively to achieve policy goals? Or should government stop using nudging communications?
- What is the responsibility that government should take in checking the impacts of its communications, if at all?
- Of Tristan Harris’ ten ‘hijacks’, which resonated most with you? Which are the most concerning hijacks tech companies use and how can government mitigate against them, if at all?
