# Code of Conduct

This Code of Conduct has been adapted (only very slightly) from that developed by the [Data Ethics Club](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/what-we-do/data-governance-and-reproducibility/) of the Jean Golding Institute. This in turn was influenced by the [Arizona Diversity Journal Club CoC](https://www.as.arizona.edu/diversity_coffee/#two), and the [Recurse Centre’s Social Rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules).

We want this discussion group to be a space where people feel welcome to discuss their thoughts and ideas. So, we have adapted this Code of Conduct (CoC) to ensure that those participating are protected from abuse, harassment or discrimination, and that the discussions we have are supportive and productive, whilst remaining in line with Chatham House Rules.

If you would like to suggest an addition or amendment then you can [make an issue](https://github.com/ukgovdatascience/data-ethics-and-society-reading-group/issues/new/choose) or submit a PR.

## Unacceptable behaviours

Unacceptable behaviours will result in immediate action and potentially lead to suspension from future meetings.
This being said, consistent and intentional disregard for the Discussion Guidelines below can also be regarded as unacceptable if such behaviour significantly disrupts the group and makes it an unwelcome environment for others.

Unacceptable behaviours include but are not limited to:

* Intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions. Within this definition we include refusal to use a person’s stated pronouns, and denying the existence of someone's experiences of discrimination.
* Harmful or prejudicial verbal or written comments or visual images related to age, background, belief, disability, ethnicity, race, religion, gender, identity, national origin, sexual orientation or other personal characteristics, including those protected by law.
* Inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images.
* Real or implied threat of professional or financial damage or harm.
* Inappropriate disruption of meetings or events.
* Photographing, video or audio recording of slides, oral or poster presentations without presenter/author’s permission.

## Discussion Guidelines

### Do…

* Be respectful of differences in experience, knowledge and background.
* Be conscious of how much space you're taking up in a conversation.
* Give people space and time to make their point if they need it.
* Use the hand-up feature

### Don't…

* Interrupt
* Feign shock/incredulity when someone doesn’t know something you think is obvious.

## Reporting Procedure

If you have been subject to or witnessed unacceptable behaviour, either during a meeting or on this repository, then you can get in touch with the organisers on [xgov-data-ethics@proton.me](mailto:xgov-data-ethics@proton.me).
