# Data Ethics and Society Reading Group

<center><img src="deas.png" alt="logo" width="200"></center>

_“Data Science isn’t neutral”;_ books such as Race After Technology, Invisible Woman and Data Feminism have highlighted the social and ethical impact of Statistics, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

The Data Ethics and Society Reading Group is a space for public sector colleagues to reflect on the ethical implications of our work. We read books, journals, blog posts, and watch videos, that relate to doing data science ethically. Read our code of conduct [here](./code-of-conduct.md).

We meet (virtually) four times a year.

> Stay tuned for details of changes to the reading group for 2025.
