# Reading list

(format borrowed from [Data Ethics Club](https://github.com/very-good-science/data-ethics-club))

- ✅ = we've read it
- 📅 = planned for an upcoming session
- 📺 = Watching/Listening/Learning material
- 💸 = open access material

This is a list of books compiled by community suggestions.

If you'd like to make a suggestion for what to read, please do so however you prefer:

- [add a suggestion to our Google Forms](https://forms.gle/qvNVX1681hkW62Lj9)
- [make an issue](https://github.com/ukgovdatascience/data-ethics-and-society-reading-group/issues/new/choose) - use the suggestion(s) template.
- make a Pull Request (PR) on [our repository](https://github.com/ukgovdatascience/data-ethics-and-society-reading-group)
- contact us via [email](mailto:xgov-data-ethics@proton.me)

The organisers then pick a handful of these books and get the community to vote on which should be read at a future event.
