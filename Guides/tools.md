# What tools we use to organise our events

Working collaboratively across the public sector is hard, and as a result we use a variety of tools and services to help us. Please note that these are up-to-date as of the time of writing but may need to change at short notice due to tool availability, pricing etc.

## Email

We use [proton mail](https://proton.me/mail) for our shared mailbox. All of our organisers have access to this mailbox.

## Messaging

We use the [Gov Data Science slack workspace](https://govdatascience.slack.com) for communicating with one another and others.

## Newsletters

We use [Substack as our mailing list](https://xgovdataethics.substack.com/welcome) and newsletter system. We have tried others but have found Substack the best, and it's free!

## Event sign-ups

We use [Ticket Tailor](https://www.tickettailor.com/) to create and ticket events (all our events are always free).

## Meetings

For all meetings, including our events, we use Microsoft Teams.

## Task Management

For logging tasks we use a private [Trello](https://trello.com/) board. This allows us to stay on top of event planning and promotion.

## Documentation

For documents and slides we use Google Docs and Slides.
