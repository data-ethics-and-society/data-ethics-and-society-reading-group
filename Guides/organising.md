# How we organise the Data Ethics & Society Reading Group

As with much of this repository, the below borrows heavily from [Data Ethics Club](https://github.com/very-good-science/data-ethics-club).

We've described how a typical meeting would run in the ['Facilitating'](./facilitating.md) document, and so this document is more about how people can contribute to the repository, and how we operate more generally.

## Deciding on material to read

The [reading list](./../READING-LIST.md) is organised into different sections - some are philosophical, some are technical. Our [previously discussed pieces are available in our Sessions Overview](./../SESSIONS.md). We like to check off things we have discussed [in the reading list](./../READING-LIST.md).

The whole group votes on what to read for the following meeting at the end of every session. A slido is pre-populated with items already on our reading list, and attendees are invited to vote for items, as well as add anything they want to read for others to upvote.

## Administrative tasks

## Contributing

### How can I contribute to the reading list?

Since we organise around a GitHub repository people can submit issues using our issue template. People can also submit pull requests, or simply send us an [email](mailto:xgov-data-ethics@proton.me) and we can upload your suggestions on to the repository - we know not everyone is comfortable using GitHub!

### How do we acknowledge contributions?

Contributions can be lots of different things, and so we use the [emoji key](#all-contributors-emoji-key) on our front page. This has been adapted from that used by [Data Ethics Club](https://github.com/very-good-science/data-ethics-club). If you think you should be listed as a contributor but can't see your GitHub handle listed, please [get in touch](mailto:xgov-data-ethics@proton.me).

### How can I get involved in organising?

We welcome any administrative and organisational help you can offer! Please get in touch via [email](xgov-data-ethics@proton.me). We'd especially like to hear from people who are new to the Civil Service and from groups usually under-represented in data science.

### I'd like to lead a session on a particular topic

Brilliant! Please reach out to us via [email](xgov-data-ethics@proton.me) and we can set this up with you.

## Communicating

We primarily use our [newsletter](https://xgovdataethics.substack.com/) to communicate with interested Data Science practitioners across government. Sign up to hear about upcoming events.
