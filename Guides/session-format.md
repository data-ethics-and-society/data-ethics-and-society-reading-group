# Session Format Guide

We have now facilitated the reading & discussion group using several different formats:

## Format A

Format A is a classic read group format. A book, book chapter or article is decided on by the group, and the group spends the session discussing the book.

### Break-out Discussions (35 mins)

The introduction is followed by semi-structured breakout out room discussions. The size of the rooms is up to you, but they should not be too large that people aren't able to contribute. Note though, some people may not want to contribute. To allow for time for everyone to talk you may want to adopt a 1-2 approach, where someone gets one minute to raise a point and everyone gets two minutes to respond. This should be a loose guide and not used to limit discussions though. If you do use this method, 10 people in a room would only get one minute each to talk about a point *they* want to talk about. Please refer to the [Facilitator Guide](Guides/Facilitator-Guide.md) for more information.

### Group Discussion (20 mins)

Everyone should be given the opportunity to regroup and to raise any discussion points, if they wish to. Some may not want to. Again, the 1-2 method may be used. The organisers should close the session, providing guidance on how to continue to discussions going forward.

## Format B

Format B comprises lightning talks and discussions around several book chapters or articles that speakers want to talk about. This is run as an hours session using a 15-30-15 method but this is only a guide and times can be adjusted if there are fewer than three speakers, or a large attendance with lots of rooms.

### Lightning Talks (15 mins)

The sessions start with up to three lightning talks, each a maximum of five minutes. Talks may cover an interesting research paper, application, blog post, anything that fits to the theme of the session. Please refer to the [Lightning Talk Guide](Guides/Lightning-Talk-Guide.md) for more information.

### Break-out Discussions (30 mins)

These talks are then followed by semi-structured breakout out room discussions. The size of the rooms is up to you, but they should not be too large that people aren't able to contribute. Note though, some people may not want to contribute. To allow for time for everyone to talk you may want to adopt a 1-2 approach, where someone gets one minute to raise a point and everyone gets two minutes to respond.

### Group Discussion (15 mins)
